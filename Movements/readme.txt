Writing a program to control turtle's movements
ROS Distro: Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04

'start.sh' starts ROSMASTER, TurtleSim and displays meassages from 'turtle1/pose' topic in a new terminal 

move_forward(distance) should calculate the linear position (x or y) based on a distance given in any orientation
For now there is only in x or y direction...
